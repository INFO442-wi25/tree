# Justification for the Hospital Waste Management Project

We chose to focus on hospital waste management to address critical issues stemming from the excessive generation of healthcare waste. Of the total amount of waste generated by healthcare activities, about 85% is general, non-hazardous waste, while the remaining 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic, flammable, or radioactive. Given that a majority of hospital waste is non-hazardous, there is a gap in innovation to manage this type of waste. Therefore, this project aligns with urgent environmental, economic, and public health priorities by providing innovative solutions to manage waste effectively.
Healthcare waste is also a significant contributor to environmental degradation. In the United States alone, healthcare facilities generate 6,600 metric tons of waste daily and account for 10% of greenhouse gas emissions (Alger). Moreover, 91% of plastics used in healthcare are not recycled, ending up in landfills or natural environments, worsening pollution rates (Jain et al.). Reducing the volume of waste sent to landfills and improving recycling can reduce these harmful effects on the environment, contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
Improper waste management also leads to enormous financial burdens on healthcare systems. A single hospital bed generates 29–33 pounds of waste daily, resulting in over 5.9 million tons of waste annually in the U.S. (Argo). By implementing better tracking and waste segregation systems, hospitals can optimize waste management, reduce costs, and allocate resources more effectively.
In addition to environmental and economic impacts, poor waste management poses significant risks to public health and healthcare workers. Hazardous waste, which accounts for 15% of healthcare waste, can be infectious, toxic, or radioactive, endangering healthcare workers and surrounding communities. For example, in Ethiopia, 35% of healthcare institutions improperly dispose of sharps, increasing the risk of exposure and injury (Janik-Karpinska et al.). This project will prioritize awareness and training to reduce health risks for workers and surrounding communities.
By addressing these critical issues, this project will not only tackle a pressing problem but also inspire sustainable change in the healthcare sector, benefiting the environment, hospital budgets, and public health. The proposed solution will allow healthcare workers to better track waste production and understand the sources of hazardous versus non-hazardous waste to improve waste management.
