Architecture

This architecture connects the digital application and physical art piece of the project to address the issue of hospital waste and demonstrate an engaging and educational solution to manage this waste. 

1. Web Application (Figma Mockup of Website)

This web application serves as the digital aspect of the project, guiding users through an interactive and educational journey with structured modules, visuals, and quizzes so hospital workers and healthcare providers can be more informed on how to manage waste properly.

Components:

Sign-In/Sign-up Page
Our Mission: highlights the importance of the waste management training
Modules
Module 1: Educational
Module 2: Interactive visuals
Module 3: Resources & Waste Management Solutions
Quiz: taken after modules are completed to receive certification on waste management
Completion Page

2. Physical Art Piece & Audio-Visual 

The physical art piece emphasizes hospital waste accumulation. By using different colors of paper to represent different types of waste, it shows the waste pile-up of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The art piece directly connects to a stop-motion video that represents the piling of trash over a 5-year period from a 500-bed hospital. This aspect of the project ties back to the web application, as users who are taking the digital training can view this video to visualize the daily/yearly waste output from a hospital. This will reinforce the importance of being trained on how to reduce non-hazardous waste and be aware of sustainable alternatives. 

Components:

100 2” x 2” pieces of paper in various colors
Red paper signifies Hazardous waste, which consists of: 
10% Infectious Waste
3% Chemical/Pharmaceutical Waste
2% Radioactive/Sharps Waste 
Brown paper signifies Non-Hazardous waste, which consists of: 
General Waste (50-60%) 
Food scraps and organic waste from hospital kitchens
Non-contaminated paper, cardboard, and packaging
Non-contaminated textiles (e.g., bed linens, gowns)
Non-hazardous plastics (e.g., packaging from non-medical supplies)
Recyclable Waste (20-25%) 
Clean plastics (e.g., water bottles, food containers)
Glass (e.g., beverage bottles, non-medical glass containers)
Paper (e.g., administrative documents, packaging)
Metals (e.g., aluminum cans, non-contaminated foil)
Other Non-Hazardous Waste (10-15%) 
Non-contaminated medical supplies (e.g., unused bandages, gauze, gloves)
Broken furniture and equipment (non-electronic, non-toxic materials)
Ash from hospital incinerators (if not containing toxic residues
Through video editing software (MS Clipchamp) and photo editing software (Picsart), a stop-motion video was created to highlight the buildup of hospital waste.


Conclusion
The hospital waste awareness project integrates both a physical demonstration and a digital platform to deliver an impactful education experience to healthcare professionals and hospital workers. The physical art piece uses color-coded paper and stop-motion animation to visually emphasize the large scale of hospital waste over time. This issue is reinforced by the digital platform through interactive modules and quizzes to deepen users’ understanding of waste management practices. Overall, this project brings awareness to the issue of hospital waste and provides an actionable solution to promote sustainable practices in healthcare settings.
