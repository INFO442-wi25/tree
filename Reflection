The most useful feedback that our group received was regarding the specificity and structure of our requirements/architecture. We realized that our requirements were more general, and will work towards making it more specific on how the user can interact with our application. As part of my role, I will help edit the architecture to be more cohesive, and also continue to ensure that the art piece follows what we've written. One tool that I might want to try is drawing an architecture diagram to outline our components more clearly and use it to guide the project.
