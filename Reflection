Reflection 1/29/25

The most useful feedback our group recieved was to restructure our requirements so they are more specific and focused on technical requirements. Currently, they were pretty broad and did not follow the format of prioritizing requirements. 

Based on the feedback, I will helping rewrite the requirements and focus on highlighting the connection between our physical art peice and our web app in further writings.

One technique I learned from the other group is how to build an architecural diagram and how it can be a useful tool to see how parts of a product connect. We will work further on our architecure and in the future I would like to try to build an architecture diagram.
